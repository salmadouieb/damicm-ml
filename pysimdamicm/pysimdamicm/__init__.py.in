"""Python Simulator Damic-M detector reponse :mod:`pysimdamicm`

.. currentmodule:: pysimdamicm


This module provides tools (and scripts) to simulate RAW data from pure SIM
data (Geant4-based simulations of the DAMIC-M detector), as well as, tools
for the pure RECONSTRUCTION process such the cluster reconstruction. 


**Include**
-------------
    1. Classes for each process involved in the response of the detector (either sensor response or electronics)

    2. Classes for the reconstruction

    3. Classes for the post data processing (creation of background spectras induced by a physical volume inthe detector geometry)

    4. Several functions to get the mass of the physical volume, the normalization of the background for different contaminants, ...
    
    5. It also contain different scripts (see :obj:`pysimdamicm.bin` at `repo <https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/damicm/pysimdamicm>`_)

        * Related to Geant4 Simulations:
            - to create macros needed to run DAMICG4 (:obj:`pysimdamicm.bin.create_macros_DAMICG4`)
            - to run the (previous) macros as jobs in the IN2P3 cluster (:obj:`pysimdamicm.bin.create_script_QSUBjobs`)

        * Related to Data Acquisition Process and Dara Reconstruction:
            - to simulate the response of the detector, as well as to
              clusterize the signal detector output (:obj:`pysimdamicm.bin.psimulCCDimg`)

        * Related to Post Data Processing:
            - to generate a comparison plot for several induced backgrounds
              (:obj:`pysimdamicm.bin.comparePVInducedBcks`)
